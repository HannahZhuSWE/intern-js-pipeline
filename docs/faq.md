# Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I add a repository to the dashboard

Follow all instructions provided under [Repo Integration](/docs/category/repository-integration/),  [Dashboard Setup](/docs/category/dashboard-setup/), and [Setup Multiple Workflows for Different Testing Purposes](/docs/category/setup-multiple-workflows-for-different-testing-purposes/).

### Can I use this project up for other languages

This project is not currently designed to support other languages. For minimal support you can follow [Automate Github Actions](./setup/repository-integration/automate-github-actions.md) and replace the npm commands with your language's test commands. Then follow all the steps in [Dashboard Setup](/docs/category/dashboard-setup/) and [Setup Multiple Workflows for Different Testing Purposes](/docs/category/setup-multiple-workflows-for-different-testing-purposes/) to set up the dashboard. This will create a dashboard that reports the test statuses of each repository but will not offer detailed test reports.
