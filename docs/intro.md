# Project Intro

This project is composed of nightly integration tests and a dashboard that consolidates all test results in one location for an easy way to ensure that all code samples can compile and run.

## Problem at Hand 

Documentation with faulty code samples drives developers away from our platform. This project adds nightly integration tests to each repository referenced in documentation. Then we can easily fix automatically identified failures and not spend time manually testing repositories.
